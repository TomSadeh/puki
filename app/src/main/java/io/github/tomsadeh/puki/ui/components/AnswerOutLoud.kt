/**
 * Lets the child answer the round's question out loud instead of tapping: once the question has
 * been asked and everyone is quiet, Puki listens for a few seconds (his corner glows). If she said
 * one of [options] (each: the words that count for it), [onAnswer] gets its index, just as if
 * she'd tapped it; after a wrong one Puki listens once more. Silence or other words end it, and
 * tapping works all along (a tap that ends the round turns the microphone off at once).
 * Needs the microphone, a brain awake to hear (PC or device) and the parent's setting.
