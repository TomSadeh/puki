/**
 * Where Puki's thinking happens: the brain server on the family PC (brain/brain.py), or this
 * device itself ([LocalBrain]). Both answer the same requests, so the rest of the game doesn't
 * care which one it talks to:
 *
 *  - GET  /health           {"brain": "ready" | "waking" | "asleep"}
 *  - POST /wake             start loading the models
 *  - POST /say              {"situation", "lang"} -> a line about it, spoken (audio)
 *  - POST /speak            {"text", "lang", "speed"} -> that text, spoken (audio)
 *  - POST /look?lang=       a PNG drawing -> a line about it, spoken (audio)
 *  - POST /listen?lang=&context=   a WAV of the child -> a spoken answer (audio)
 *  - POST /repeat?lang=&target=&alt=   a WAV -> {"heard", "match"} (Say it with Puki)
 *  - POST /story            {"played", "icons", "lang"} -> {"sentences": [{"text", "icon"}]}
 *
 * Every POST also carries ?name=&gender= (the child, from the app's settings).
